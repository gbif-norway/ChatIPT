# #Â I think best is to let it spawn new Agents 
# it needs to have a set list of tasks it works through
# or should it have just a state it needs to get to before it can proceed to the next task? taht seems more promising 

# maybe should just mark old dataframes as 'stale' when it makes a new one? or set a date archived_on
