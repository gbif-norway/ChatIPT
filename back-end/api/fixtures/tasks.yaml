- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: extract_subtables
    per_table: false
    text: >
      Separate out any sub tables in this dataframe into new, separate Tables. 

- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: flatten_headers
    per_table: true
    text: >
      Flatten any of the top rows which you think might contain header information into a single row, and convert it to the dataframe header. If there are multiple candidate header rows, try to preserve as much information as possible when you merge them. 
    
- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: drop_unnecessary_rows_and_columns
    per_table: true
    text: >  
      Drop any unnecessary rows and columns. Particularly, look out for SUM/TOTAL rows at the bottom of the dataframe, and SUM/TOTAL columns at the end of it. If there are any other rows or columns which are not necessary or seem meaningless, remove those too. This is just a first pass to weed out obvious problems - we will map columns to the Darwin Core standard in a later Task.
    
- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: de_crosstab  #Â Convert crosstab/pivot to long.
    per_table: true
    text: >  
      Is this table in crosstab or pivot format? Often users have a crosstab of species x locations, with the value cells being individualCount or organismQuantity. If this is the case, convert the crosstab to long format, label the new column accordingly and present it to the user for confirmation. Don't forget to save changes to the database before marking this Task as complete.
    
- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: set_core_and_extensions
    per_table: false
    text: >  
      Carefully examine the contents of each of these dataframes. Set the DwC core and DwC extension for this dataset. Take your best guess at what these should be, and then discuss it with the user.

- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: organize_tables
    per_table: false
    text: >  
      Depending on the DwC core and DwC extensions this dataset has, organize the Tables, joining or deleting dataframes as necessary so the data structure resembles what is required.

- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: mapping
    per_table: false
    text: >  
      Depending on the DwC core and DwC extensions this dataset has, map the columns to the correct darwin core terms. Present these to the user to make sure you have not misunderstood anything. If column names are too cryptic, ask the user about them. Drop any unnecessary columns, and generally get the data into shape. Validation and format checking is the next Task. 

- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: validation
    per_table: false
    text: >  
      Check each of the newly mapped darwin core fields for validation errors. Pay particular attention to dates, and get these in the right column. Additionally, check the required fields for each DwC core and DwC extension, and make sure they are present. 

- model: api.task
  fields:
    name: adhoc
    per_table: false
    text: >  
      Carefully inspect these preprocessed dataframes. They should be nearly ready for publication. Are there any other outstanding issues you can see? Fix these and mark your Task as complete when you think there are no more issues and the dataframes are ready for publication.
