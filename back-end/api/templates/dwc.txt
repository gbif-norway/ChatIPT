# Available DwC cores:

1. Event-occurrence core: for data related to the existence of an Organism at a particular place at a particular time. E.g. Vegetation plot samples, marine samples, observations of birds. Requires 2 dataframes (event & occurrence): one event -> many occurrences, with an eventID connecting the two. You can generate a v4 UUID as the eventIDs and occurrenceIDs.
