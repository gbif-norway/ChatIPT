eventRemarks	Comments or notes about the Event	After the recent rains the river was nearly at flood stage.
waterBody	The name of the water body in which the Event occurred	"Indian Ocean, Hudson River, Lago Nahuel Huapi"
countryCode	The standard code for the country in which the Event occurred	"AR, SV"
locality	The specific description of the place where the Event occurred	"Bariloche, 25 km NNE via Ruta Nacional 40 (=Ruta 237), Queets Rainforest, Olympic National Park"
minimumElevationInMeters	"The lower limit of the range of elevation (altitude, usually above sea level), in meters"	"-100, 802"

maximumDepthInMeters	"The greater depth of a range of depth below the local surface, in meters"	"0, 200"
locationRemarks	Comments or notes about the Location	under water since 2005
decimalLatitude	"The geographic longitude (in decimal degrees, using the spatial reference system given in geodeticDatum) of the geographic center of the event"	-41.0983423
decimalLongitude	See decimalLatitude	-121.1761111
geodeticDatum	"The ellipsoid, geodetic datum, or spatial reference system (SRS) upon which the geographic coordinates given in decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude as based"	"EPSG:4326, WGS84, NAD27"
coordinateUncertaintyInMeters	"The horizontal distance (in meters) from the given decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude describing the smallest circle containing the whole of the Location. Leave the value empty if the uncertainty is unknown, cannot be estimated, or is not applicable (because there are no coordinates). Zero is not a valid value for this term"	30 (reasonable lower limit on or after 2020-05-01 of a GPS reading under good conditions if the actual precision was not recorded at the time)
footprintWKT	"A Well-Known Text (WKT) representation of the shape (footprint, geometry) that defines the Location.
